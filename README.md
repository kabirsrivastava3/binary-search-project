# binary-search-project

# Implementation of binary search algorithm!!

# We will prove that binary search is faster than linear search!


# Essence of binary search:
# If you have a sorted list and you want to search this array for something,
# You could go through each item in the list and ask, is this equal to what we're looking for?
# But we can make this *faster* by leveraging the fact that our array is sorted!
# Searching trough a list? Never check every item.

# Time Complexity:
# Binary search ~ O(log(n)), linear search ~ O(n)
